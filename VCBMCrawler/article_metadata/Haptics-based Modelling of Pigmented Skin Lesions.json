In order to become competent in diagnosing skin lesions, it is important to encounter multiple examples of a condition, as they vary between individuals. Three popular lesions have been identified due to their importance, including nodular melanoma, seborrhoeic keratosis and cherry haemangioma. In this paper we propose a haptics-enabled learning tool for pigmented skin lesions based on haptic texturing. Geometrical modelling, skin deformation and haptics modelling are described. Results of the implementation are presented along with an initial validation study comparing the haptics-based simulator with other methods, including temporary tattoos and silicon made models."}
