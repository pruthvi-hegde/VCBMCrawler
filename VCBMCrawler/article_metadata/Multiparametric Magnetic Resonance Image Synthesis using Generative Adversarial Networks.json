However, most generative models for medical images focus on image-to-image translation rather than de novo image synthesis. In many clinical applications, image acquisition is multiparametric, i.e. includes contrast-enchanced or diffusion-weighted imaging. We present a generative adversarial network that synthesizes a sequence of temporally consistent contrast-enhanced breast MR image patches. Performance is evaluated quantitatively using the Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance, achieving a minimum FID of 21.03. Moreover, a qualitative human reader test shows that even a radiologist cannot differentiate between real and fake images easily."}
