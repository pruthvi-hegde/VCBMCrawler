Findings are usually reported as printouts, screen shots and video sequences. However, in certain scenarios, the amount of imaged ultrasound data is considerable or it is challenging to detect the anatomical features of interest. Post-examination access to the information present in the data is, therefore, cumbersome. The examiner must, in fact, review entire video sequences or risk to lose relevant information by reducing the examination to single screen shot and printouts. In this paper we propose a novel post-processing pipeline for guided visual exploration of ultrasound video sequences, to allow easier and richer exploration and analysis of the data. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by applying it to a liver examination case, showing easier and quicker ultrasound image selection and data exploration."}
