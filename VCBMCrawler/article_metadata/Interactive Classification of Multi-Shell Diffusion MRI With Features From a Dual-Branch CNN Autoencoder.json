This yields large and intricate data for which very few interactive visualization techniques are currently available. We designed and implemented the first system that permits an interactive, iteratively refined classification of such data, which can serve as a foundation for isosurface visualizations and direct volume rendering. Our system leverages features learned by a Convolutional Neural Network. CNNs are state of the art for representation learning, but training them is too slow for interactive use. Therefore, we combine a computationally efficient random forest classifier with autoencoder based features that can be pre-computed by the CNN. Since features from existing CNN architectures are not suitable for this purpose, we design a specific dual-branch CNN architecture, and carefully evaluate our design decisions. We demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate classifications compared to learning with raw data, established domain-specific features, or PCA dimensionality reduction."}
