While this approach is suitable for most applications, certain cardiovascular diseases, such as aortic dissection would benefit from a more comprehensive visualization. In this work, we investigate different shading styles for the visualization of the aortic inner and outer wall, including the dissection flap. Finding suitable shading algorithms, techniques, and appropriate parameters is time-consuming when practitioners fine-tune them manually. Therefore, we build a shading pipeline using wellknown shading algorithms such as Blinn-Phong, Oren-Nayar, Cook-Torrance, Toon, and extended Lit-Sphere shading with techniques such as the Fresnel effect and screen space ambient occlusion. We interviewed six experts from various domains to find the best combination of shadings for preset combinations that maximize user experience and the applicability in clinical settings."}
