There are ample choices of recent techniques for image registration which can be used, and a technique suitable for image registration of the pelvis region supporting the femoral nerve block was applied for the development of patient-specific models. Virtual physiological human (VPH) model and magnetic resonance image (MRI) are used for patient-specific image registration. Results are presented in the form of image registration with respect to the skin of the models."}
