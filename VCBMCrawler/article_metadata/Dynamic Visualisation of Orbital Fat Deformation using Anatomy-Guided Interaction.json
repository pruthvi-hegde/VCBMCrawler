Orbital fat plays an important role in the working of this system, but its behaviour during eye movement is not well understood. To give insight into this behaviour, visualisation is a useful tool. This paper presents a complete pipeline for interactive particle-based visualisation and exploration of orbital fat deformation from MRI data. Sensible 3D particle seeding is important in this type of visualisation. We address that problem with a two-step process: Interactive, anatomy-guided slice positioning, and contour-based region of interest specification. Since the deformation calculation is unlikely to be correct everywhere, we derive and visualise an uncertainty measure based on deformed and original MRI data. We also performed a case study evaluation to investigate the benefits of our approach towards orbital fat deformation visualisation."}
