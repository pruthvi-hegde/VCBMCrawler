Their robustness, however, has to be examined more thoroughly before clinical use is possible. We present a novel framework that enables robustness evaluation of CFD simulation according to mesh deformation on patient-specific blood vessel geometry. Our tool offers a guided workflow to generate, run, and visualize OpenFOAM simulations, which significantly decreases the usual overhead of CFD simulations with OpenFOAM. Besides, the deformation of the original geometry allows the user to evaluate the robustness of the simulation without the need to repeat expensive operations of the data pre-processing phase. We assessed the robustness of CFD simulations by applying our framework to several aneurysm data sets."}
