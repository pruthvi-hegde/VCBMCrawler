Shape", "abstract": "Besides other main criterias like size, infiltration and anatomical district, the sideness of tumor and local metastases (i. e., malignant lymph nodes) is very crucial for head and neck tumor assessment. An automatic sideness determination may speed up tumor staging noticeably. Inspired by preliminary work of others we present a modified approach for the estimation of the midsagittal plane based on surface meshes. The suitability of the computed result being used in the course of TNM classification was tested in a case study, in terms of an according automatic determination of the sideness for segmented lymph nodes and tumors."}
