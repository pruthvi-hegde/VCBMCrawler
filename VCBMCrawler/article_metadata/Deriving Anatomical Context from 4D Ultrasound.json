This information can in turn be placed into the context of a CT or MRI scan of the same patient. However for such an approach many image processing challenges need to be overcome and sources of error addressed, including reconstruction drift, anatomical deformations, varying appearance of anatomy, and imaging artifacts. In this work, we present a fully automatic system including robust image-based ultrasound tracking, a novel learning-based global initialization of the anatomical context, and joint mono- and multi-modal registration. In an evaluation on 4D US sequences and MRI scans of eight volunteers we achieve automatic reconstruction and registration without any user interaction, assess the registration errors based on physician-defined landmarks, and demonstrate realtime tracking of free-breathing sequences."}
