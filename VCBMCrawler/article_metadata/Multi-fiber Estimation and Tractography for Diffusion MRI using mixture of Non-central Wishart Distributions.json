One such model is the mixture of central Wishart distributions. In this paper, we use our recently proposed model to estimate the orientations of crossing fibers within a voxel based on mixture of non-central Wishart distributions. We present a thorough comparison of the results from other fiber reconstruction methods with this model. The comparative study includes experiments on a range of separation angles between crossing fibers, with different noise levels, and on real human brain diffusion MRI data. Furthermore, we present multi-fiber visualization results using tractography. Results on synthetic and real data as well as tractography visualization highlight the superior performance of the model specifically for small and middle ranges of separation angles among crossing fibers."}
