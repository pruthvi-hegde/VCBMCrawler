Due to the large overall cell count on histological slides and the potential sparse prevalence of some relevant cell types or mitotic figures, retrieving annotation data for sufficient statistics is a tedious task and prone to a significant error in assessment. Automatic classification and segmentation is a classic task in digital pathology, yet it is not solved to a sufficient degree. We present a novel approach for cell and mitotic figure classification, based on a deep convolutional network with an incorporated Spatial Transformer Network. The network was trained on a novel data set with ten thousand mitotic figures, about ten times more than previous data sets. The algorithm is able to derive the cell class (mitotic tumor cells, non-mitotic tumor cells and granulocytes) and their position within an image. The mean accuracy of the algorithm in a five-fold cross-validation is 91.45 %. In our view, the approach is a promising step into the direction of a more objective and accurate, semi-automatized mitosis counting supporting the pathologist."}
