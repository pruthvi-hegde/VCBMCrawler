Currently, tools for the joint analysis of multiple biological and clinical information in this field are insufficient or lacking. Our tool fills this gap by enabling bio-medical experts to explore datasets of cancer patient cohorts. By using multiple coordinated visualization techniques, nested visual queries on various data types can be performed to generate/prove a hypothesis by identifying discrete sub-cohorts. We demonstrated the utility of discoVA by a case study involving bio-medical researchers."}
