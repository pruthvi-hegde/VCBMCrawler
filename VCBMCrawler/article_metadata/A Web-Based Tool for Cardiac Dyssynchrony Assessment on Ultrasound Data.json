The positive outcome of CRT depends strongly on the parameters criteria used to select patients and a lot of research has been done to introduce new and more reliable parameters. In this paper we propose an interactive tool to perform visual assessment and measurements on cardiac ultrasound images of patient with cardiac dyssynchrony. The tool is developed as a web application, allowing doctors to remotely access images and measurements."}
