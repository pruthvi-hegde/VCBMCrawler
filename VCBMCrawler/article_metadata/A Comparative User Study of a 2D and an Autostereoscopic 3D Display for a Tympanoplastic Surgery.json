We investigated depth perception comparing a 2D display with a glasses-free 3D autostereoscopic display in detail and conducted a follow-up study with the new 3D zSpace technology including a stylus as input device. This work comprises the design of a tympanoplastic training scenario used as the study's \"real world task\". Participants had to position a prosthesis implant to reconstruct the ossicular chain and thus a patient's hearing ability. The study revealed an overwhelming support of the 3D autostereoscopic display compared to a 2D display regarding depth judgment, task completion time and the number of required scene and prosthesis interactions."}
