A student uses a fully immersive VR headset to explore the anatomy of the base of the human skull. A teacher guides the student by using the semi-immersive zSpace. Both systems are connected via network and each action is synchronized between both systems. The teacher is provided with various features to direct the student through the immersive learning experience. The teacher can influence the student's navigation or provide annotations on the fly and hereby improve the student's learning experience."}
