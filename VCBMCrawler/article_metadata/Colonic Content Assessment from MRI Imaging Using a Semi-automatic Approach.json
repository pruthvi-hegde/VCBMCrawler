Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an important imaging technique since it is able to visualize soft tissues in an undisturbed bowel using no ionizing radiation. In the last few years, MRI of gastrointestinal function has advanced substantially. However, few studies have focused on the colon, because the analysis of colonic content is time consuming and cumbersome. This paper presents a semi-automatic segmentation tool for the quantitative assessment of the unprepared colon from MRI images. The techniques developed here have been crucial for a number of clinical experiments."}
