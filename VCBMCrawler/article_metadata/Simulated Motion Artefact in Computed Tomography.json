It includes five components: anatomic data, respiration modelling, automatic parametrisation, X-ray simulation, and tomography reconstruction. It is used to generate motion artefacts in reconstructed CT volumes. Our framework can be used to evaluate CT reconstruction algorithm with motion artefact correction in a controlled environment."}
