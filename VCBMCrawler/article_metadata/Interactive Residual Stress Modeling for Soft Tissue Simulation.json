Due to the release of residual stress after cutting, soft tissues will shrink and the wound will open. Thus, to realistically simulate soft tissue deformations due to cutting, a model for the residual stress in a patient body is needed. In this paper we present an interactive method to compute a physically meaningful patient-specific residual stress distribution. With our method, by using their experience doctors can sketch directional stress strokes and specify stress magnitudes at a few control points on the body surface. The residual stress is then immediately computed from these inputs and visualized by displaying the deformations of a set of control cuts on the body. In a visually guided session, the user can further modify the initial strokes and magnitudes until a satisfactory result is obtained. We demonstrate the potential of the proposed method for virtual cut simulation by showing the variations of wound openings depending on the residual stress distribution."}
