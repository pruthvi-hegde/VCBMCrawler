The whole pipeline of processing algorithms is presented, starting from generating topologically equivalent surface meshes, followed by solving the correspondence problem, and, finally, creating a surface morphing. In this pipeline, we address all the challenges that are due to dealing with complex biological, non-isometric objects. For biological objects it is often particularly important to obtain deformations that look as realistic as possible. In addition, spatially non-uniform shape morphings that only change one part of the surface and keep the rest as stable as possible are of interest for evolutionary studies, since functional modules often change independently from one another. We use Poisson interpolation for this purpose and show that it is well suited to generate both global and local shape deformations."}
