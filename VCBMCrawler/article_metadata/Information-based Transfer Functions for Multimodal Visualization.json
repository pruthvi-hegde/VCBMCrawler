In multimodal visualization at least two values exist at every sample point. Additionally, other parameters, such as gradient magnitude, are often retrieved for each sample point. To find a good transfer function for this high number of parameters is challenging because of the complexity of this task. In this paper we present a general information-based approach for transfer function design in multimodal visualization which is independent of the used modality types. Based on information theory, the complex multi-dimensional transfer function space is fused to allow utilization of a well-known 2D transfer function with a single value and gradient magnitude as parameters. Additionally, a quantity is introduced which enables better separation of regions with complementary information. The benefit of the new method in contrast to other techniques is a transfer function space which is easy to understand and which provides a better separation of different tissues. The usability of the new approach is shown on examples of different modalities."}
