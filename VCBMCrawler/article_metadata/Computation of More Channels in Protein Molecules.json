Chemists also require that more than one ideal channel be computed in a static protein molecule. Three basic approaches for computation of more than a single channel were introduced in recent publications. However, these approaches have several disadvantages. In this paper we propose a new adaptive method for computation of more channels. This new method is piloted on a real data and results are compared with channels identified by chemists as relevant. The comparison indicates that this method is a significant improvement over previous methods, as the method computes less number of similar and biochemically insignificant channels."}
