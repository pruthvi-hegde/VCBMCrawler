In this context, there is a strong need for software that can deal with dynamic data of different kinds (i.e. images, meshes, signals, etc.). In this paper we propose a platform that aims at helping researchers and clinicians to visualise and process such dynamic data, as well as evaluate simulation results. To illustrate this platform we chose to follow a concrete clinical application, the personalised simulation of the Tetralogy of Fallot. We show that the software provides the user with a significant help in the assessment and processing of the 3D+t raw data, as well as an adapted framework for visualisation and evaluation of various dynamic simulation results."}
