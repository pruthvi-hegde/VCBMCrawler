The reconstructed neurons are morphologically complex 3D graphs whose nodes are annotated with labels representing different types of synapses. Here, we propose a method to draw simplified, yet realistic 2D neuron sketches of insect neurons in order to help biologists formulate hypotheses on neural function at the microcircuit level. The sketches are dendrograms that capture a neuron's branching structure and that preserve branch lengths, providing realistic estimates for distances and signal travel times between synapses. To improve readability of the often densely clustered synapse annotations, synapses are automatically summarized in local clusters of synapses of the same type and arranged to minimize label overlap. We show that two major neuron classes of an olfactory circuit in the larval fruit fly brain can be discriminated visually based on the dendrograms. Unsupervised and supervised data analysis reveals that class discrimination can be performed using morphological features derived from the dendrograms."}
