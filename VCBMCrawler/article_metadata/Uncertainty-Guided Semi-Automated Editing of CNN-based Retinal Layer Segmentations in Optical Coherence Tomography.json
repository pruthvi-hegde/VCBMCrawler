Despite this, in many cases, results are still not reliable enough to be trusted ''blindly''. Consequently, a human rater is responsible to check correctness of the final result and needs to be able to correct any segmentation errors that he or she might notice. For a particular use case, segmentation of the retinal pigment epithelium and Bruch's membrane from Optical Coherence Tomography, we develop a system that makes this process more efficient by guiding the rater to segmentations that are most likely to require attention from a human expert, and by developing semi-automated tools for segmentation correction that exploit intermediate representations from the CNN.We demonstrate that our automated ranking of segmentation uncertainty correlates well with a manual assessment of segmentation quality, and with distance to a ground truth segmentation. We also show that, when used together, uncertainty guidance and our semi-automated editing tools decrease the time required for segmentation correction by more than a factor of three."}
