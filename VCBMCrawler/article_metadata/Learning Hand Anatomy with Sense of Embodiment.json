The prototype is designed to support embodied cognition, i.e., a learning process based on movements. The learner employs the prototype in VR by moving their own hand and fingers and observing how the virtual anatomical hand model mirrors this movement. The display of anatomical systems and their names can be adjusted. The prototype is deployed on the Oculus Quest and uses its native hand tracking capabilities to obtain the hand posture of the user. The potential of the prototype is shown with a small user study."}
